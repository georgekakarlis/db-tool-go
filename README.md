an on-going recipe database/forum that I am building from scratch for my side-project [thetastetable.com](https://thetastetable.com) and the beta of it : [beta.thetastetable.com](https://main--spectacular-semolina-5a4d96.netlify.app/). It is using PostgreSQL in Docker and Go. It is not using any ORM abstraction layer, but rather using the native SQL queries and commands (or at least to-be).
